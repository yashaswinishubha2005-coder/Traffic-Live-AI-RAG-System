# Real-Time Traffic Incident Analysis & Management System

## Project Overview

This project is developed for the Pathway Inter IIT hackathon challenge. It aims to solve urban traffic congestion by combining historical data analysis with real-time incident reporting. The system uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach to provide actionable AI-driven recommendations when new traffic incidents occur.

The core of the application is built on Pathway's philosophy of handling data that "thinks and adapts". By analyzing live incident reports against historical traffic patterns, the tool provides severity alerts, rerouting recommendations, and visualizes hotspots on an interactive map.

## Key Features

- **Live Incident Reporting**: Users can report incidents (accidents, floods, etc.) which are immediately appended to the `traffic_live.csv` dataset for processing.

- **AI Traffic Analysis**: Utilizing a mock embedding system (as per current `app.py` implementation) to perform cosine similarity searches between live incidents and historical cases.

- **Dynamic Severity Alerts**: Automated risk assessment that triggers "High" or "Medium" confidence alerts based on vehicle counts and incident severity.

- **Interactive Visualization**: A live map powered by Pydeck that highlights incident locations using real-world coordinates (e.g., Bangalore junctions).

- **Actionable Insights**: Recommended actions like "Deploy traffic police" or "Optimize signal timings" generated based on incident severity.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Streamlit (UI/UX)
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn (Cosine Similarity for RAG)
- **Geospatial Visualization**: Pydeck
- **Platform**: Pathway (Contextual Intelligence)

## Project Structure

- `app.py`: The main Streamlit application containing the RAG logic, UI, and map visualization.
- `traffic_live.csv`: A dynamic dataset that stores incoming live incident reports entered through the app.
- `traffic_original.csv`: A historical dataset containing extensive traffic records (DateTime, Junction, Vehicles) used for similarity retrieval.

## How It Works

1. **Data Input**: When an incident is logged in the Streamlit sidebar, the app captures the Junction ID, Incident Type, Severity, and Vehicle Count.

2. **Historical Retrieval**: The system scans `traffic_original.csv` to find similar past occurrences using cosine similarity.

3. **Analysis**: The AI evaluates the current severity. If the severity index is >= 4, it recommends immediate rerouting; otherwise, it suggests continued monitoring.

4. **Mapping**: The incident is plotted on the map using predefined junction coordinates.

## Getting Started

### 1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install streamlit pandas numpy sklearn pydeck
```

### 2. Run the application:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
